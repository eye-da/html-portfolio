<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Ayda, a 20-year-old Computer Science student, about to begin my final
  year of study.<br />
  <br />
  When I started this journey, I had never written a single line of code and
  I’ll admit, there were times I doubted myself and wondered if I belonged here.
  But I kept going, and somewhere between frustration and fascination, I fell in
  love with it. What once felt intimidating has become a genuine passion. To me,
  programming feels like pulling back the curtain on a secret world. Sometimes
  it even feels like I’m in a spy movie, cracking codes and uncovering patterns
  only a few people can see.

  But beyond the thrill, I’m here for the impact. My goal is to use technology
  not just to build cool things, but to make a tangible difference in people’s
  lives. Whether that’s improving everyday tasks, creating more inclusive
  digital spaces, or designing systems that help communities, I want my work to
  have impact. Right now, I’m just writing code. But in the future, I hope I’ll
  be writing change.
